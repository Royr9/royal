CSS library made using SASS.

Made based on a sass tutorial lessons in youtube given by Net Ninja.

Compiled to css using gulp.

Includes a simple index.html file demonstrating the basic features of the library. can be seen in this url: https://royr9.github.io/royal-css/

Can be easily customised and expended and customised specifically to different projects needs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.

## Usage

- Clone to your local repo
- Delete index.html content and replace your own
- Create a new sass folder
- @import "royal" in your index.scss file inside the sass folder.
- Update the gulp file to watch your new sass folder

## Notes

- Includes a css compress function and purger to compile only used css styles and to compress the css file to one line
- I would comment them out on development stage to retain the auto-complete of classes in the html files, and uncomment before deploying...
